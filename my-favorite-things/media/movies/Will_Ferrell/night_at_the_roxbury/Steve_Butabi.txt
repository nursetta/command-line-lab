Wealthy Yemeni-American brothers Steve and Doug Butabi enjoy frequenting nightclubs, where they bob their heads in unison to Eurodance, a subgenre of dance music, commonly doing it to Haddaway's hit song "What Is Love" and also fail miserably at picking up women. Their dream is to party at the Roxbury, a fabled Los Angeles nightclub where they are continually denied entrance by a hulking bouncer. By day, the brothers work at an artificial plant store owned by their wealthy father, Kamehl. They spend most of their time goofing off, daydreaming about opening a club as cool as the Roxbury together, and Doug using credit card transactions as an excuse to flirt with a card approval associate via telephone that he calls "Credit Vixen." The store shares a wall with a lighting emporium owned by Fred Sanderson. Mr. Butabi and Mr. Sanderson hope that Steve and Emily, Sanderson's daughter, will marry, uniting the families and the businesses to form the first plant-lamp emporium.
